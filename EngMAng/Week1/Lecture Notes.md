# Planning:
---
Strategic -> Tactical ->Operational

*Strategic* - highest level and involves senior management to set the vision and mission, as well as the approach taken to achieve these.

*Tactical* - concerned with activating the strategy to make it work. Tactical plans are of a shorter time-frame and involve lower-level units within each division. This is often the job of middle-management, to convert strategy into action.

*Operational*  - involves managers at middle and lower levels. Managers work with supervisors, team leaders, and facilitators to break down the company goals into short-term objectives for easy implementation
