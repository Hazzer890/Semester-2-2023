# Objective
---
The objective of these tests is to begin profiling characteristics of our motor to form a complete model. These initial tests will be designed to measure the stall torque of our motor at 12v.

# Assumptions/Simplifications
---
- There is zero elasticity in our string
-

# Methodology

1. Assemble Mecano structure to support motor and spring balance
2. Prepare 3 pulleys of varying radii 
	1. Attach string to pulley using the pocketed holes in the face
	2. Tie a noose knot on the loose end of the string 
3. Attach a pulley to the motor and the noose knot* to the spring balance
4. Connect the motor to a 12v power supply 
5. Enable power supply
6. Wait for motor to stop spinning (stall)
7. Record force (Nm) from spring balance and current (A) from power supply*
8. Repeat with alternate pulley
