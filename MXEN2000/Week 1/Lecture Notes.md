Its gonna be an interesting semester. Gonna have to stay on top of the lab work.

Milestones - 50%
Initial Modelling Assignment - 15%
Final Model Submission - 35%

# Assignment:
---
1- *Information Gathering* 
	- Identify Subsystems, Parameters, and Variables
	- Draw schematic and block digram
	- Make common sense predictions
2- *Preliminary Model*
	- Simple eqns for each subsystem from previous unit knowledge
	- Use prior eqns to calculate the time for the cart to climb ramp
	- Use MatLab to implement eqns in order to generate graphs (Displacement, Velocity, Acceleration, Motor Speed)
3- *Reflect on model quality*
	- Is it accurate? 
		- Yes? Great!
		- No? Did you make correct assumptions? Did you collect enough information, quality or type?

# To prep for lab:
---
- How to characterise the solar panel - test in lab
- How to measure stall torque
- Make milestone template
